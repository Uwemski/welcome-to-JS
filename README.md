#For the purpose of gaining basic understanding of Javascript and its interaction with HTML, this repo was created. However, it contains for now the Pig Game creation which was taught by code instructor JonasSchmedtman which shows the manipulation of the DOM with JS. Cool right!?
So far we've learnt how to query ID's and Classes using the querySelector, getElementById to manipulate style, html etc
We've also learnt how to use the basic of JS in the game i.e expressions ,Arrays, If-else statement, ternary operators.
The addEventListener was also introduced and it was a bit strange but i'm still trying t wrap my hands around. By uusing eventListeners, we were opportuned to visit functions and the idea of callback, anonymous functions.
